# Skills Directory

This directory contains skill definitions for the Claude Marketplace.

## Skill Structure

Each skill should be placed in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
skill-name/
├── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest
├── skill-name.md         # Skill definition
└── README.md            # Skill documentation
```

## Coming Soon

This directory is prepared for future skill implementations. If you're interested in contributing a skill, please follow the structure above and refer to the [Claude Code Skills documentation](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code/skills).
