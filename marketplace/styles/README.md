# Output Styles Directory

This directory contains output style definitions for the Claude Marketplace.

## Style Structure

Each style should be placed in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
style-name/
├── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest
├── style-name.md         # Style definition
└── README.md            # Style documentation
```

## Coming Soon

This directory is prepared for future output style implementations. If you're interested in contributing a style, please follow the structure above and refer to the [Claude Code Output Styles documentation](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code/output-styles).
