## Overview

[Brief description of what this plan aims to accomplish, why it's needed, and what success looks like.]

**Scope:** What's included and what's explicitly out of scope

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable criteria for successful completion]

---

## Goals

> Goals are high-level outcomes we want to achieve.

- [ ] **[G-1]** [Goal description] │ *Success Criteria: [how we measure completion]* │ *Risk Level: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]*
- [ ] **[G-2]** [Goal description] │ *Success Criteria: [how we measure completion]* │ *Risk Level: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]*

---

## Constraints

> These are hard requirements that MUST be satisfied.

### Must Haves
- [ ] **[MUST-1]** [Technical requirement]
- [ ] **[MUST-2]** [Security requirement]
- [ ] **[MUST-3]** [Performance requirement]
- [ ] **[MUST-4]** [Compatibility requirement]

### Must Nots
- [ ] **[MUST-NOT-1]** [What we must NOT do]
- [ ] **[MUST-NOT-2]** [What we must NOT do]

### Trade-offs
- [ ] **[TRADE-1]** [Trade-off we're accepting] │ *Rationale: [why]*

---

## Tasks

> Tasks are specific work items. Each checkbox requires evidence for completion.

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

> **Phase Goal:** [What this phase accomplishes]

- [ ] **[T-1.0]** [Task description] │ *Constraint: [relevant MUST]* │ *Validation: [how verified]*
  - [ ] **[T-1.1]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*
  - [ ] **[T-1.2]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*
  - [ ] **[T-1.3]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

> **Phase Goal:** [What this phase accomplishes]

- [ ] **[T-2.0]** [Task description] │ *Constraint: [relevant MUST]* │ *Validation: [how verified]*
  - [ ] **[T-2.1]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*
  - [ ] **[T-2.2]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*

### Phase 3: [Phase Name]

> **Phase Goal:** [What this phase accomplishes]

- [ ] **[T-3.0]** [Task description] │ *Constraint: [relevant MUST]* │ *Validation: [how verified]*
  - [ ] **[T-3.1]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*
  - [ ] **[T-3.2]** [Subtask] │ *Must: [requirement]* │ *Evidence Required: [proof of completion]*

## Risk Register

> Track potential risks and their mitigations. Challenger will verify these are addressed.

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| [Risk 1 description] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [Mitigation strategy] | [OPEN/MITIGATED/CLOSED] |
| [Risk 2 description] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [Mitigation strategy] | [OPEN/MITIGATED/CLOSED] |
| [Risk 3 description] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [LOW/MED/HIGH] | [Mitigation strategy] | [OPEN/MITIGATED/CLOSED] |

---

## Assumptions

> These are assumptions we're making. Challenger will challenge these.

- [ ] **[ASSUMP-1]** [Assumption] │ *Impact if wrong: [what happens]*
- [ ] **[ASSUMP-2]** [Assumption] │ *Impact if wrong: [what happens]*
- [ ] **[ASSUMP-3]** [Assumption] │ *Impact if wrong: [what happens]*

---

## Dependencies

> External dependencies this plan relies on.

- [ ] **[DEP-1]** [Dependency] │ *Required by: [task]* │ *Status: [AVAILABLE/BLOCKED]*
- [ ] **[DEP-2]** [Dependency] │ *Required by: [task]* │ *Status: [AVAILABLE/BLOCKED]*

---

## Definition of Done

> A task is ONLY complete when ALL of the following are satisfied:

- [ ] Code is written and passes all tests
- [ ] Security review passed (no vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Challenger validation passed
- [ ] Evidence provided for completion claim
